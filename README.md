# Description
This code is an implementation of the game higher or lower.
The format of the game is that the player is presented with 10 face down cards. 
The first card is turned and the player must guess if the next card is higher or lower than the revealed card.
The next card is revealed and if the player is right, the game continues, guessing if the next card is higher or lower.
If the player is wrong, the game ends and the player loses.
If the final card is revealed with the player guessing higher or lower correctly, they win.
The player can choose to swap the first card and the fifth card when they are reached.
# Command Line Use
